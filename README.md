## 📖 About This Cookbook

This repository serves as my personal cookbook, where I collect, refine, and document solutions, templates, and implementations for various algorithmic problems. The codes within are inspired by challenges from platforms like **Codeforces, LeetCode, AtCoder**, and others that I encountered during my competitive programming journey.

The main goal is to build a reliable, well-organized, and reusable set of tools that can be quickly adapted for programming contests and technical interviews.

## 🗂️ What's Inside?

Here is a breakdown of the directory structure and the codes you can find in this codebook.

| Directory                   | Description                                                                 |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 📁 `algorithms`             | 🧠 Implementations of fundamental algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching).      |
| 📁 `data_structures`        | 🏗️ Code for core data structures (e.g., Segment Tree, Fenwick Tree, Trie).  |
| 📁 `dynamic_programming`    | 💡 Classic DP problem solutions and common patterns.                        |
| 📁 `graphs`                 | 🕸️ Graph algorithms from traversals to shortest paths and network flow.      |
| 📁 `math`                   | 🔢 Mathematical algorithms essential for CP (e.g., Number Theory, Combinatorics). |
| 📁 `strings`                | 🔡 String processing algorithms (e.g., KMP, Z-algorithm, Hashing).            |
| 📁 `templates`              | 📜 Reusable boilerplate code and templates for contests.                      |
| 📁 `utility`                | 🛠️ Helper functions, custom comparators, and other useful snippets.          |

## 💻 Tech Stack

The primary language used in this repository is **C++** for its performance and extensive use in the competitive programming community.

## 🚀 How to Use

Feel free to browse the code, use the templates as a starting point for your own solutions, or learn from the different implementations. The code is generally optimized for speed and efficiency, as it is common in competitive programming.

To use a template or algorithm:
1.  Navigate to the relevant directory.
2.  Copy the code from the file.
3.  Adapt it to the specific problem you are solving.

## 🤝 How to Contribute

While this is a personal journey, suggestions and improvements are always welcome! If you find a bug, have a better implementation, or want to suggest a new problem/algorithm, feel free to:
1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingAlgorithm`).
3.  Make your changes.
4.  Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingAlgorithm'`).
5.  Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingAlgorithm`).
6.  Open a Pull Request.
